<p>createProxy does not guarantee that the service is available.</p>

<p>it just provide a proxy to the service.</p>
<h3 id='possible-solutions'>possible solutions:</h3>
<p>using retryRouter when creating the proxy.
retryRouter will ping the registry before the remoteCall till the service is registered.</p>

<h2 id='does-the-order-of-services-is-important-when-using-the-dependency-hook'>Does the order of services is important when using the dependency hook?</h2>
<p>The order of the services you provide is the order in which they are registered in the registry.</p>

<p>but, you don&#39;t need the service in the registry in order to create a proxy to it.</p>

<p>farther more, it is possible to use the dependency hook for services that are located in other microservice instances. </p>
<h3 id='possible-solution'>possible solution:</h3>
<p>it is common to apply retry logic in order to make sure the service will run.</p>

<p>No, they are both optional.</p>
<h3 id='why-to-provide-seedaddress'>Why to provide seedAddress?</h3>
<p>seedAddress is used to connected to a distributed environment.</p>

<p>you must provide the address to one of the microservice instance in the distributed environment you want to joined.</p>
<h3 id='why-to-provide-address'>why to provide address?</h3>
<p>It is important to set your microservice instance address 
if you want that other microservice instance will use it as seedAddress.</p>

<p>farther more, microservice without address won&#39;t be able to share it services in the distributed environment.</p>

<p>if no address is provided, then microservice bootstrap will generate address for you. 
auto generate address stop you from sharing your services in the distributed environment.</p>
